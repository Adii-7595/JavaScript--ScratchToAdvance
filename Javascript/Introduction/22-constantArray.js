//constant Array:
const arr= [1,2,3,4,5]
arr.push(4)
console.log(arr)
arr.pop()
console.log(arr)

// here const arr means we can't completely change the array but we can change the element of this array 
//b'coz we are making constant variable that is arr which stores the address of the element not the element so that we 
//can change the element
